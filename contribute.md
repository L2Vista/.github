## Adding Support for New Chains

To contribute support for new chains, follow these steps:

   - `chainId`: A unique identifier for the chain.
   - `logo`: A circular image (400 x 400) representing the chain.
   - `blockchain-explorer`: The link to the blockchain explorer for the chain.

2. (Optional) **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a new branch in your fork for your changes.
   - Add the chain information (use `chainId` as the logo's file name).
   - Submit a pull request to the main repository.
